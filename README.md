An application to evaluate the scheduling mechanism of three real-time systems algorithms namely C-EDF, PSN-EDF and GSN-EDF.
The application considered in this study is a video processing application created using C and FFMPEG decoders. This application was chosen because it has interested real-world characteristics, for e.g.., video frames have variable processing times and dependencies and because real-time correctness is straightforward to define, for e.g., display jitter should be low. The reason EDF scheduling algorithm was used is because all the frames in the video application will have relative deadline appropriate to the time when they are released. Hence the frames will be decoded in the order of increasing relative deadlines.
